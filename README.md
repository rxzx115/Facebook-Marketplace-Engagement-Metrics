Insights and recommendations: 
    1) 2017 is the first year where there were more comments than reactions. This suggests that the content in 2017 was more likely to spark discussions and opinions rather than just quick expressions of sentiment or broad dissemination.
        - Strategize content that encourages discussion and opinion sharing. This could include asking open-ended questions, running polls, or posting thought-provoking content.
    2) The comments segmented by status type indicates that video posts generated the highest number of comments. This suggests that video content is a highly engaging format for this audience, due to the nature of videos sparking conversation.
        - Prioritize the production and promotion of video content on the platform, focusing on themes and styles that have historically generated high comment volume. 
    3) The distribution of comments indicates that the majority of individual posts received a relatively small number of comments, while a few posts likely drove the high total comment count. 
        - Implement strategies to increase baseline engagement across all posts. This could involve optimizing posting times, using relevant hashtags, and actively engaging with early commenters.
